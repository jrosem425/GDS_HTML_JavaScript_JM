            <b>
                HI!
            </b>
            My name is 
            <u>
                Jamie Miller. 
            </u>
            I am part of the 
            <i>
                Video Game Develpment
            </i>
            program. 
            I am very exited about this course and the program as a whole. 
            I love the way the program is structured with having so much hands on learning and experience along the way. 
            Another thing about me is that I love the game Stardew Valley.
            I have almost 2000 hours on it. 
            I have basically experienced and know everything thats on the wiki, and don't need to reference it too much anymore. 
            I have recently started a modded playthrough, and am in my second year of that playthorugh.
